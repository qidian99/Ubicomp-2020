**Designing The Catbus: Interactive Support for Early Childhood Emotional Well-being in Education**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/1424859/images/7687570/pasted-from-clipboard.png)

**The Design of the CatBus** **has the following focus:**

* Promote early childhood emotional well-being in educational contexts.
* Introduce children to recognize their own emotions, guide their thinking and behavior around their emotions, and achieve academic goals.
* Reinforce mediated communication and interaction modalities between the educators and young students.
* Help young children to benefit from wearable affective technology as a personified and imaginary friend in the educational context to remedy their emotional well-being and cognitive challenge



**The following principles specifically guide the design of the Catbus’ features and affordances:**

* **Emotion Perception and Identification:** Make it easy for young children to recognize and assign a single word to label a feeling state.
* **Emotion Expression and Communication:** Make it easy for young children to effectively and appropriately communicate their emotional expressions through characters.
* **Ethics:** Safeguard violation or privacy norms and unscrupulous uses of children’s emotions detection, recognition, expression, and manipulation.
* **Playfulness:** Make the interface feel friendly, joyful, inviting, and playful, with a positive spirit of interaction design.
* **Classroom Support:** Foster use in the classroom context and a wide range of emotional and cognitive outcomes.

**Current and Next Steps for the Catbus project involves the following four phases - I through IV:**

* **Phase I:** collect baseline data, identified design principles, and created the initial prototype.
* **Phase II:** examine the validity and coherence of children's reports of their emotions.
* **Phase III:** evaluate the interactive system with the broader.
