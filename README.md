# Ubicomp 2020

The ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing, [UbiComp 2020](http://ubicomp.org/ubicomp2020/), is the result of a merger of the two most renowned conferences in the field: Pervasive and UbiComp. While the shorthand conference name retains the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, the full conference name reflects the dual history of the new event.  
  
[UbiComp 2020](http://ubicomp.org/ubicomp2020/) is collocated with the ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers, [ISWC 2020](http://iswc.net/iswc20/), the premier international venue for Wearable Computing.  
  
The main conference track will feature 100+ papers accepted in the last four ACM IMWUT Journal, as well as ISWC Briefs and Notes.
